REQ-34 (exact session-setup failure copy + refresh-oriented button label while keeping reload behavior unchanged) cannot be verified from the provided truncated LoginPage diff. Additionally, LoginPage includes new post-login error handling and routing-related state/effects that go beyond the request to only adjust user-facing text and panel placement/order.",
